# Chennai House Price Prediction

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Chennai, India. The model is trained on a dataset of various features related to the houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and more.

The goal of this project is to help buyers determine a fair price for a house and provide insights to sellers on what factors can fetch them higher prices for their properties.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is stored in the file train-chennai-sale.csv. It contains the following variables:

- PRT_ID: Project ID
- AREA: Area where the house is located
- INT_SQFT: Total area of the house in square feet
- DATE_SALE: Date on which the house was sold
- DIST_MAINROAD: Distance from the house to the main road (in meters)
- N_BEDROOM: Number of bedrooms
- N_BATHROOM: Number of bathrooms
- N_ROOM: Number of rooms
- SALE_COND: Sale conditions
- PARK_FACIL: Parking facility availability
- DATE_BUILD: Date on which the house was built
- BUILD_TYPE: Type of the house
- UTILITY_AVAIL: Utilities available for the owner of the house
- STREET: Street where the house is located
- MZZONE: Chennai regions divided into multiple zones
- QS_ROOMS, QS_BATHROOM, QS_BEDROOM, QS_OVERALL: Masked data
- REG_FEE: Registration fees
- COMMIS: Commission
- SALE_PRICE: Price at which the house was sold


## Getting Started

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook Chennai_House_Price.ipynb to access the code.
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and generate the house price predictions.

## Preprocessing

The code performs several preprocessing steps on the dataset, including:

- Renaming columns to lowercase
- Dropping irrelevant columns (PRT_ID, REG_FEE, COMMIS)
- Handling missing values by filling them with appropriate statistical techniques
- Correcting data types of columns (N_BEDROOM, N_BATHROOM, DATE_SALE, DATE_BUILD)
- Creating a new column house_age based on the DATE_SALE and DATE_BUILD columns
- Encoding categorical variables using ordinal encoding and one-hot encoding

## Model Building and Evaluation

The code builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models for house price prediction, including:

- Linear Regression
- K Nearest Neighbors Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression

For each model, the code calculates the cross-validation score and R2 score to assess its performance.

### Feature Importance

The code also provides insights into the importance of different features in predicting house prices. It uses the Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting models to determine the feature importance and visualizes the results in bar charts.

## Suggestions to Sellers and Buyers

Based on the feature importance analysis, the code provides suggestions to sellers and buyers on factors that can influence house prices. Sellers are advised to focus on the following features to build homes that fetch higher prices:

- Age of the building
- Area (location) of the building
- Number of rooms
- Build type (commercial properties tend to have higher prices)
- MZ zone
- Parking facility availability
- Number of bedrooms
- Area (in square feet) of the building
- Number of bathrooms
- Street type (paved streets are preferred)
- Sale conditions
- Utilities available
- Conclusion

The Chennai House Price Prediction model can be used by buyers to estimate fair prices for houses and assist sellers in understanding the factors that can fetch higher prices for their properties. The model provides a valuable tool for the real estate market in Chennai, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
